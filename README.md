# Bohemia Jumper

A simple platformer made with the help of a tutorial from GDQuest.

This is made to show, it doesn't take a long time to create a simple game.

This is my first game ever made and also my first experience with Godot.
My only previous experience was coding in Python, c, js and a bit of c#.

I really recommend the tutorial, I think it explains the concepts clearly and concisely enough.
The tutorial itself is split into 3 parts, with overall length being like 5 hours.
(part 1 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc13Z2gboEk)

The textures are different from the ones in the tutorial.

Godot also really impressed me. It's a great program.
And The fact, it's open-source makes it even greater.

It falls under the MIT license from Godot (duh),
which you can find here: https://godotengine.org/license
and creative commons from GDQuest (CC BY 4.0 - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
You can do anything you want with this code, I don't care.
(of course, as long as it doesn't violate the licenses)

again A big thanks to both GDQuest and the Godot devs
